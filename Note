Good day sir,

I have difficulties answering the following questions:


1 Which color of shirt is the mean color?

3 Which color is the median?

4 BONUS Get the variance of the colors

From my experience and further research,
Mean, median and variance can only be calculated for numerical values like weight, height, age, length, marks, etc. But not for colors.
If there is a way around this, I would like to learn sir.
